This was my first ever website! It's made entirely of HTML5 so it doesn't look too great, but it's my first so I wanted to keep it here.

This was a project for the course "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. It has a lot of really great content so I'd reccommend checking it out! You can find it on https://www.udemy.com.

I'm also working on a stylized personal website for when I start doing free lance web design. Stay tuned for that.
